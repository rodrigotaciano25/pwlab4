            <p class="factsText">The metropolitan area is divided into the Federal District, established in 1880, and
                the surrounding
                suburbs. The Federal District contains less than one-fourth of the population of the metropolitan area,
                a proportion that shrinks as the suburbs continue to attract industry and residential communities. The
                limits of the Federal District are marked by the Riachuelo River and Avenida General Paz, which was
                opened in 1941 after nearly a decade of construction. The city is divided into sections that coincide
                mostly with the traditional barrios (neighbourhoods).</p>

            <p class="facts"> Buenos Aires Metro System Is The Oldest In Latin America</p>
            <p class="factsText">In 1913 the first metro system on Latin American soil opened in Buenos Aires. The first
                line in that time was “Linea A”. It connected the presidential palace (Casa Rosada) with the Congress.
                The stations are beautifully decorated with ornaments of that time. The Buenos Aires metro system is the
                13th oldest metro system in the world. Younger than the underground system of London – opened in 1890 –
                but older than the metro system in Madrid that had its first ride in 1919.</p>
